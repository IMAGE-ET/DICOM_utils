Python scripts to do things with DICOM files. Depends heavily on [pydicom](https://github.com/darcymason/pydicom) but currently only works for version < 1.0 of pydicom.

Scripts include:

* A DICOM anonymizer which will remove identifiable information from DICOM files.

All scripts are released under the MIT license.
