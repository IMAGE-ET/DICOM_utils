# DICOM utils

Python scripts to do things with DICOM files. Depends heavily on [pydicom](https://github.com/darcymason/pydicom) but currently only works for version < 1.0 of pydicom (tested with 0.9.8).

Scripts include:

* A [DICOM anonymizer](https://github.com/marenaud/DICOM_utils/wiki/DICOM-Anonymizer) which will remove identifiable information from DICOM files.

# LICENSE

All scripts are released under the MIT license.
